Compile the following C language file :: gcc -S filename.c

 
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int xx = 83;

int main(int argc,char* argv[])

{

    int counter= 87;

    printf("%d",33+44);

    printf("Program Name Is: %s",argv[0]);

    printf("%d",33+44);

    fprintf(stderr,"Hey, I am an error message!!!");

    return 0;

}
```

1. Read about C language reading the command line arguments and explain the C program statements.
2. Read about C language stderr printing and explain.
3. Hey, where is that 33+44 happening?
4. Local variable and global variable in assembler? Where?
5. Cut/paste the assembler file into a document. Type the associated C language on the right hand side at the appropriate place in the assembler. Use LOTS of your analysis on the right hand side of the paper to EXPLAIN the assembler code. What part of the assembler is what part of the C program? What is some of the extra crap?

Might want to print the code, mark up by hand, take pics and submit the pics.
